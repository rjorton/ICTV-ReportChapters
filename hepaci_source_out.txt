The best characterised member of the Hepacivirus genus is hepatitis C virus (HCV), classified as a member of the species Hepacivirus C (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27692039" target="ictvref" title="Smith et al., 2016, Proposed update to the taxonomy of the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus within the Flaviviridae family, J Gen Virol, 97, 11, 2894-907">Smith et al., 2016</a>). HCV infects humans and is an important aetiological agent of chronic hepatitis. A further hepacivirus, GB virus-B (GBV-B), highly divergent in sequence from HCV, was first described in tamarins in 1995 in which it establishes acute infections and liver pathology comparable to that of HCV (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7724574" target="ictvref" title="Simons et al., 1995, Identification of two flavivirus-like genomes in the GB hepatitis agent, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 92, 8, 3401-5">Simons et al., 1995b</a>). Several other hepaciviruses have recently been described that infect Old World colobus monkeys, various rodents and bats species, European and African cattle, horses and donkeys (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918769" target="ictvref" title="Sibley et al., 2014, Discovery and characterization of distinct simian pegiviruses in three wild African Old World monkey species, PLoS One, 9, 2, e98569">Sibley et al., 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27795428" target="ictvref" title="Walter et al., 2017, Differential Infection Patterns and Recent Evolutionary Origins of Equine Hepaciviruses in Donkeys, J Virol, 91, 1">Walter et al., 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25787289" target="ictvref" title="Corman et al., 2015, Highly divergent hepaciviruses from African cattle, J Virol, 89, 11, 5876-82">Corman et al., 2015</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25926652" target="ictvref" title="Baechlein et al., 2015, Identification of a Novel Hepacivirus in Domestic Cattle from Germany, J Virol, 89, 14, 7007-15">Baechlein et al., 2015</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21610165" target="ictvref" title="Kapoor et al., 2011, Characterization of a canine homolog of hepatitis C virus, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 108, 28, 11608-13">Kapoor et al., 2011</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22491452" target="ictvref" title="Burbelo et al., 2012, Serology-enabled discovery of genetically diverse hepaciviruses in a new host, J Virol, 86, 11, 6171-8">Burbelo et al., 2012</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23572554" target="ictvref" title="Kapoor et al., 2013, Identification of rodent homologs of hepatitis C virus and pegiviruses, MBio, 4, 2, e00216-13">Kapoor et al., 2013b</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23818848" target="ictvref" title="Drexler et al., 2013, Evidence for novel hepaciviruses in rodents, PLoS Pathog, 9, 6, e1003438">Drexler et al., 2013</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25316698" target="ictvref" title="Firth et al., 2014, Detection of zoonotic pathogens and characterization of novel viruses carried by commensal Rattus norvegicus in New York City, MBio, 5, 5, e01933-14">Firth et al., 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23610427" target="ictvref" title="Quan et al., 2013, Bats are a major natural reservoir for hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 110, 20, 8194-9">Quan et al., 2013</a>). These viruses have been assigned to further hepacivirus species and show distinct host ranges - Hepacivirus A (non-primate hepacivirus, NPHV) infecting horses and possibly dogs, Hepacivirus B (GBV-B) infecting tamarins and potentially other New World primates, Hepacivirus D infecting colobus monkeys, Hepacivirus E, Hepacivirus F, Hepacivirus G, Hepacivirus H, Hepacivirus I and Hepacivirus J infecting various species of rodents, Hepacivirus K, Hepacivirus L and Hepacivirus M infecting bats and Hepacivirus N infecting cows. A currently unclassified, more divergent hepacivirus-like sequence has been assembled from liver tissue of a gracile shark (Wenlin shark virus).
